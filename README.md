This project provides a minimal binding of the libubertooth functions to the Lua interpreter. Lua5.1 and Lua5.4 are supported. This is a work in progress and not all functions of libubertooth are available. It is only possible to collect spectrum analyzer data at the moment.

The ```examples``` folder contains a hopefully useful example: https://github.com/muhkuh-sys/org.muhkuh.lua-lubertooth/tree/master/external

Pre-build releases can be found here: https://github.com/muhkuh-sys/org.muhkuh.lua-lubertooth/releases
